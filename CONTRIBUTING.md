### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Adding New Evaluation Criteria

If you want to add a new evaluation criterion:

1. Edit `src/evaluator/criteria.ts`
2. Add your new criterion to the `evaluationCriteria` array
3. Update the recommendation logic in `generateRecommendations`
4. Test with various repositories

Example:
```typescript
{
  name: 'My New Criterion',
  description: 'Checks for something important',
  weight: 10,
  check: (repo: RepositoryInfo) => {
    // Your evaluation logic here
    return someCondition;
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Test your changes with various repositories:

```bash
# Test with well-maintained repos
rr evaluate facebook/react
rr evaluate microsoft/vscode

# Test with repos that need work
rr evaluate torvalds/linux

# Test error cases
rr evaluate nonexistent/repo

# Test creation (requires GitHub token)
rr create --token your_token
```
